We provide several data sets for knowledge bases. 

(1) Numerical data for the entities in the FB15k knowledge graph. FB15k is a commonly used knowledge graph in the KB completion literature. Both FB15k and FB15k-237 can be used with the numerical data. The data set and one method for integrating numerical data into a joint machine learning model are described in the following paper.

The second data set consists of a set of images associated with each of the entities in the FB15k knowledge graph. For now, we provide a list of URLs that can be downloaded with an FTP application. In a separate list, we match the Freebase IDs to their image URLs.  The crawler is available here. The paper describing the data set, possible visual queries, and a method for answering these queries are introduced in the following paper.

Feel free to use the data sets but please cite the respective paper(s).
